# Email Writer Extension
Email Writer is a browser extension that enhances your email composing experience by adding an AI Reply button to your email compose toolbox. This button generates a reply based on the content of the email you received, making your responses faster and more efficient.

## Features:
- AI-Generated Replies: Click the "AI Reply" button in your email compose toolbox to get an AI-generated reply tailored to the content of the email you received.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: The extension seamlessly integrates into your email client, providing a user-friendly interface for generating replies.
- Web Interface: If you prefer not to use the extension, visit our website where you can copy-paste the email content and receive an AI-generated reply.

## How It Works:
- Once the extension is installed, open your email client (such as Gmail).
- When composing an email, the AI Reply button will appear in your email compose toolbar.
- Click the AI Reply button, and the extension will send the email content to an AI service.
- The AI will analyze the email content and generate a professional, context-aware reply that you can easily insert into your email.
- Alternatively, you can use the website to copy and paste the email content and get a reply from the AI.
